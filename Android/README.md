Introduction
====

Tutorials repo consists of tutorial projects which include Chute SDK library and are used to help a developer get started with Chute.

All the tutorials are written for the Android OS and assume you have the basic knowledge of JAVA and Android programming. They also assume that you have the android SDK and JDK setup and you are using Eclipse IDE with the android developer tools plugins installed. Since most of the tutorials will work with code samples written for Android, any IDE other than Eclipse might be used for development.
